A simple Caesar cypher encoder/decoder, it consists on shifting a character 3 letters away in the alphabet. Meaning A becomes D and Z becomes C.

I made it to only work accordingly on capital letters and numbers. Everything else, except for blank spaces, gets kinda weird, becoming any char on the ASCII table.

It was pretty simple to do. I just added 3 to the ASCII value of each char in the encryption, and reduced 3 in the decryption.
