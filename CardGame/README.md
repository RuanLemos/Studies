The program asks the user to input three cards (number and a letter that represents its kind). If the cards are valid, the program outputs 5 results:

1. Are they all from the same kind?
2. Are they all from different kinds?
3. Do they make a three of a kind?
4. Do they make a straight?
5. Do they make a straight flush?

It was kinda challenging and pretty fun to do, helping a lot with understanding how String and char manipulation works

The code is entirely sequential and stays in the same "block of code" given that, at the time, we (college students) still didn't learn to separate functions nor use OOP.
